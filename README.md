# FanControl.i18n
All of [FanControl's](https://github.com/Rem0o/FanControl.Releases) string resources for translation.

## To contribute
For a given language, say french, each json file needs a ".fr.json" version, with the exact same keys in the json file as the default ".json".
Any missing key will result this specific string to use the default (english) string.
Try and keep the relative size of the string close to the original, to avoid layout issues.

We are using [IETF BCP 47](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/bcp/bcp47.txt) as default for Windows locale names, like suggested [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/globalization/locale/standard-locale-names)
The most common language codes can be found [here](https://www.techonthenet.com/js/language_tags.php)

These translations will be pulled into the software periodically.
